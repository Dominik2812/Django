# MyDirtyDjango

## Why dirty?
...cause it's not clean. The projects that I present here are very ambitious beginner projects that are however not optimized, contain no error handling and do not follow the *pep8* conventions. But I posted them anyway as they have been extremely useful for me, either from the didactic point of view or in terms of solving real world challenges; perhaps this applies also to you too. The project **DjangoMachineLearning** can be used by scientists to rapidly *classify their data via supervised learning methods*.
