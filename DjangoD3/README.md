Moreover the actions are categorized, such that the actions " Django " and "Laravel"  would derive from "programming" and "running" from sports. 
Each of those action can then serve as a label for futher actions, such as "uploading on github" apllys to both "Django" and "laravel". 
please consider the code not as ready to use app but as a template that may be modified and extented to meet your own purposes. 


The project combines Django architecture with Javascript (Vanilla), Google API and d3 design.
The design is kept simple yet any suggestions or imporvements are welcome.
